# Single CLA

fork-to-sign CLA for all pull-request-driven projects

You can:

- [Read the terms for yourself.](./cla.md)  If something doesn't make sense, [that's the terms' fault, not yours](https://flippedform.com).

- [Sign the CLA, using Git, a text editor, and your account.](#signing)

- [Review a checklist for responsible PRs to others' projects.](./checklist.md)

- Help improve these terms and tools, by opening issues and pull requests on [singlecla/singlecla](https://github.com/singlecla/singlecla).

## Signing

1.  Fork [https://github.com/singlecla/singlecla](https://github.com/singlecla/singlecla) to your personal GitHub account.  Make sure you fork the default `main` branch.

2.  Make a commit signing [`cla.md`](./cla.md) by replacing `{{{name}}}` with your full legal name.  The result will look like:

    ```markdown
    ## Signature

    Signed: /Ada Lovelace/
    ```

3.  Push your new commit to your forked repository so the page at `https://github.com/{your handle}/singlecla/blog/main/cla.md` shows your signature.
