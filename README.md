# Single CLA

fork-to-sign contributor licensing agreement for all pull-request-driven projects

Users fork this repo under their own accounts.  The original project repository is <https://github.com/singlecla/singlecla>.

You can:

- [Read the terms for yourself.](./cla.md)  If something doesn't make sense, [that's the terms' fault, not yours](https://flippedform.com).

- [Sign the CLA, using Git, a text editor, and your GitHub or other Git hosting account.](#signing)

- [Review a checklist for responsible PRs to others' projects.](./checklist.md)

- Help improve these terms and tools, by opening issues and pull requests on [singlecla/singlecla](https://github.com/singlecla/singlecla).

## Signing

1.  [Have a look through the terms.](./cla.md)  They were written to be read.  And understood.

2.  [Fork https://github.com/singlecla/singlecla](https://github.com/singlecla/singlecla/fork) to your personal GitHub account.

3.  Make a commit signing [`cla.md`](./cla.md) by replacing `{{{name}}}` with your full legal name.  The result will look like:

    ```markdown
    ## Signature

    Signed: /Ada Lovelace/
    ```

4.  Push your new commit to your forked repository so the page at `https://github.com/{you}/singlecla/blog/main/cla.md` shows your signature.

## Verify

You can verify that you or someone else has a valid, signed Single CLA using a [provided script](https://github.com/singlecla/verify).
