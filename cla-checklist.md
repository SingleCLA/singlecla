# Single CLA Checklist

1.  Fork [https://github.com/singlecla/singlecla](https://github.com/singlecla/singlecla) to your personal GitHub account.  Make sure you fork the default `main` branch.

2.  Make a commit signing [`cla.md`](./cla.md) by replacing `{{{name}}}` with your full legal name.  The result will look like:

    ```markdown
    ## Signature

    Signed: /Ada Lovelace/
    ```

3.  Push your new commit to your forked repository so the page at `https://github.com/{your handle}/singlecla/blog/main/cla.md` shows your signature.
