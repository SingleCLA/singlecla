# Single CLA

Version 2.0.0

## Purpose

This contributor license agreement sets out the licenses and assurances that I give for my contributions to public software projects on this website.  That way project stewards can accept my contributions without fear of licensing problems and I can sign one contributor license agreement, rather than one for each project.

## Scope

### Pull Requests

This CLA applies to every pull request that I open offering a contribution:

1.  to a public software repository

2.  on the same website where I published this CLA in the `singlecla` repository under my account name

3.  for a project that gathers rights to license contributions in a single project steward, such as a foundation, company, or lead developer

This CLA also applies to a pull request if I specifically say it applies in a comment to that pull request.  For example, I might say:

> My Single CLA applies to this pull request.

### Exceptions

This CLA does _not_ apply to a pull request if I specifically say it does not apply in a comment to that pull request before it is accepted.  For example, I might say:

> My Single CLA does not apply to this pull request.

### Withdrawal

This CLA does _not_ apply to any pull request that I open on this website after removing this signed CLA from the `singlecla` repository under my account name.

## Licensing

### My Own Work

When I make contributions of work that I have the legal right to license:

1.  I license the project steward to do everything with my work that would otherwise infringe all copyrights in it that I can license.

2.  I license the project steward to do everything with my work that would otherwise infringe any patents that I can license.

3.  I license the project steward to do everything with my work that would otherwise infringe any database rights in it work that I can license.

4.  These license grants cover rights I can license at the time I open my pull request, as well as rights I become able to license later.

5.  I license the project steward to pass these rights on to, or sublicense, anyone or everyone, under any terms they choose, one or many times.  s examples, this covers releasing the project under new public license terms, as well as licensing the project to specific customers on commercial license terms.

6.  I cannot and will not revoke these license grants.

7.  As far as the law allows, I waive any moral rights I have in the work.

8.  ***As far as the law allows, my work comes as is, without any warranty or condition, except for my promises under [Rights to License](#rights-to-license).***

### Others' Work

When I make contributions including work that others have the legal right to license:

1.  I promise to mention in comments to my pull requests when that work isn't clearly licensed under permissive open license terms that Blue Oak Council rates "bronze" or better at <https://blueoakcouncil.org/list>.

2.  I promise to include copies of copyright notices, license terms, and other licensing documentation in my contribution, so the project steward can tell from files in the project's repository who licensed what work under what terms.

## Rights to License

### All Work

When I make a contribution, all the work in it will be covered by this CLA.

### Awareness

I am aware of legal rules, like ["work made for hire"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_for_hire) rules, that can give employers and clients ownership of intellectual property rights in my work.  I am also aware that legal agreements I make [can transfer ownership of intellectual property rights in my work to others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_(law)), such as companies and other organizations that I found, work for, or sell my work to.  I am aware that due to rules and agreements like these, I may not have the legal right to license intellectual property in work I myself create.

### Permission

When I offer a contribution with permission from an organization or another person that might have the legal right to license intellectual property in it, I promise to mention all the following in comments to my pull request:

1.  the fact that an organization or another person might have the legal rights to license intellectual property in my contribution

2.  the name of the person or organization that might have those legal rights

3.  whether and how they gave me permission to contribute

For example, I might say:

> I did this work while on the job for Example, Inc.  They may have the legal right to license intellectual property in it.  I asked my manager for permission to contribute, and she pointed me to the company's open source policy, which is online at <https://example.com/open-source-policy>.

### Company and Client CLAs

If a project steward asks me to help get a CLA from someone who may have the legal right to license intellectual property in my contribution, I promise to help the project steward request that CLA.  I am aware that only people with legal authority can sign CLAs on behalf of companies and other organizations.  For corporations, that often means executive officers.

## Reliability

I fully expect project stewards, users, and distributors of public software projects to rely on this CLA.  I am aware that they might enforce this CLA as a legally binding agreement.
